------------------------------------------------------ DESCRIPTION ------------------------------------------------------
To run the program, type "make" to compile everything and then type "java " followed by which main you want to run.
Ex: "java ExamTaker"
You can type "make clean" to get rid of the class files you create when compiling.

There are 3 main files in this program, which are:
ExamBuilder: Runs an infinite loop where you are prompted to choose between a list of options.
			 When an option is selected, the action associated with that option will be performed.
			 The program will only end when the Quit option is selected.
ExamTaker: Asks for a student's name and an exam file to load.
		   Then, a new exam is created from that exam file and the student is forced to complete it.
		   The student's answers are saved to a file when they're done answering questions.
ExamGrader: Loads an exam file and an answer file and checks if they're matched.
			Then, the answers are evaluated and the results are printed to the screen.
		

-------------------------------------------------------- NOTES ----------------------------------------------------------
- The ExamGrader will accept filenames as command line arguments in the following formats:
        1) answer file and exam file
        2) multiple answer files and an exam file
        3) multiple answer files
        4) no command line arguments
                - If no command line arguments are provided the user will be prompt for a 
                answer filename and the exam file will be loaded from the exam filename listed in the answer file.

- The grader will grade each exam and display the score, if multiple exam are included all exam will display with names and respective scores on a final scoreboard.
